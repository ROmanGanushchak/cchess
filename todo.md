ToDo:
1. Make the connection of libs in engine and moves
2. Correct bugs after the movePiece changes
3. Make invertMove for PGN
4. Add forward and back with MOVE_DETAILS

Additional:
1. Think about validating only actual move in movePiece, removeInvalid only for the move itself

Add to consider project finished:
1. PGN exporter and importer
2. Add material difference
3. Check the correctness of program with possible move counter
